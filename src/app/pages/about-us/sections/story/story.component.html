          <p>
            At Roure Personal Training, we believe that taking care of your body shouldn’t feel
            complicated, overwhelming, or disconnected from real life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Life is busy. Work, family, social commitments all compete for your time and energy.
            Exercise is often the first thing to be postponed, and starting (or restarting) on your
            own can feel hard.
          </p>
          <p>That’s where we come in.</p>
          <p>
            We offer personal, structured coaching that makes training approachable, effective, and
            enjoyable supporting both your physical and mental well-being.
          </p>
